# JavaScript Objects: Assignment

## Problems

### 1: The Reading List

Let's write a small program to keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read.

1. Create an **Array** of **Objects**
1. Each **Object** in the **Array** should describe a book and have the following properties:

   1. Title (**String**)
   1. Author (**String**)
   1. alreadyRead (**Boolean**)

      A **Boolean** that indicates whether you already read the book

1. Iterate a.k.a Loop through the **Array** of **Objects** containing the books
1. For each book, print the book title and author as shown below:
   ```
   The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
   ```
1. Now use the `if/else` statement to change the output depending on whether you have already read the book or not
   1. If you have read the book, print a string as shown below:
      ```
      You have already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien
      ```
   1. If you haven't read the book, print a string as shown below:
      ```
      You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien
      ```

```js
// Your Answer1. For each book, print the book title and author as shown below:   The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien

const theReadingList = {
  title: ["Refusal", "Macbeth", "Diamond In the Jungle"],
  author: ["Soazig Aaron", "William Shakespeare", "Agatha Christie"],
  alreadyRead: ["Yes", "No"]
};

for (let i = 0; i < theReadingList.length; i++) {}

console.log(`
The ${theReadingList.title[0]}  by ${theReadingList.author[0]} 
`);

console.log(`
The ${theReadingList.title[1]}  by ${theReadingList.author[1]} 
`);

console.log(`
The ${theReadingList.title[2]}  by ${theReadingList.author[2]} 
`);

// You have already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien

const theReadingList = {
  book1: ["Refusal", "Soazig Aaron", "Yes"],
  book2: ["Macbeth", "William Shakespeare", "No"],
  book3: ["Diamond In the Jungle", "Agatha Christie", "Yes"]
};

for (let i = 0; i < theReadingList.length; i++) {
  console.log(theReadingList[i]);
}
```

### 2: The Fastest Ship in the Galaxy

Let's start you with a small ship to work on. Follow each prompt in the comments below to solve the given problem and add your solution code next to it.

```js
const ship = {
  name: "Millennium Falcon",
  speed: 42,
  crew: ["Han Solo", "Chewbacca"],
  passengers: [],
  famous: true,
  heardOfIt: function () {
    console.log("You've never heard of the millennium falcon?");
  }
};
